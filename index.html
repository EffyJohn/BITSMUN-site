        <h4 class="letter__body">
            It is my great pleasure to present to you the 12th edition of BITSMUN to be held from 27<sup>th</sup> to 29<sup>th</sup> March 2020. <br><br>
            Boasting to be one of the oldest college conferences in India, we at BITSMUN Pilani pride ourselves on giving delegates the best experience possible. Since its inception, BITSMUN Pilani has had delegates not only from India but also from other countries like the United States, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, bringing over 300 engaging minds together. Our aim has always been to generate interest and concern about problems and issues that infect the world so that today’s youth can learn to solve tomorrow’s problems.<br><br>
            BITSMUN 2020 will have 5 committees whose agendas are both relevent and interesting. With a dynamic and experienced Executive Board, an exciting experience is assured. This year, BITSMUN in association with APOGEE, BITS Pilani's technical fest, will also have a series of talks by eminent personalities from different walks of life. In addition to these talks, there are several events planned to enhance your experience with us.
            We look forward to hosting you for three days of intense debate, stimulating discussions and shrewd diplomacy, in what we hope turns out to be one of the most memorable experiences of your life. <br><br>
      
            Regards,
        </h4>
